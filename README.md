# 🛡️ Eternum

**Eternum** is a zero-trust defense shell, AI-forensic engine, and immutable truth protocol — built to protect those who’ve been silenced, erased, or misrepresented.

This project was born out of necessity — not theory.

It defends the undefended by embedding audit trails, forensic signatures, and whistleblower traps into modular, composable infrastructure.

## 🔥 What It Does

- 🧠 AI-assisted metadata logging + analysis
- 📡 IPFS-based tamper-proof evidence storage
- 🧱 Smart contract defense + mirror deployment tools
- 🕵️ Decentralized whistleblower submission protocols
- 🔒 Encrypted identity modules for sovereign builders

## 📍 Immutable Deployment

> All critical infrastructure is logged to IPFS and cryptographically verified on-chain.

This is not just software — it's a **witness**, a **safeguard**, and a **sword**.
